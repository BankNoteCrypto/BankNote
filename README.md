BANKNOTE (BN)

Bank Note is the new branding and evolution of DojeCoin, created as community takeover by Team Yasuki to move away from controversial doggie brand and take coin to higher level of existence.  The coin itself is a scrypt coin that is now pure Proof of Stake and works very nicely, many people enjoy using the coin itself and the staking wallet.  Team Yasuki brings business and technical experience into the coin to bring it to place the original developer was incapable to do.

The Bank Note community is strong and many people believe in this crypto coin and enjoy fellowship on IRC.  We will be bringing many new developments to Bank Note including a multipool for supporting the coin on exchanges, casino gaming, paper wallet, merchant interfaces, among many plans.

Our goal is to foster inclusive community where every voice is heard, no oppression or insanity actions.

After the Proof-of-Work digging period Bank Note has many less coins than original target of 80B, less than half that many, only 30B in circulation.  This increase value of coin very much.  But is still enough coins for everybody to have fun with and use for many things.  We think it hits the sweetest spot of balance.

You may download updated Bank Note Safe with new branding.  Nothing else changes in coin, only the branding and graphics art.
